## ðŸš€ Version 1

- âœ… **Transferring SOL to new wallet**: After buying and selling in one wallet, it transfers SOL to a newly created wallet and continues buying and selling there.
- âœ… **Maker increase**: New wallets are created every round of buying and selling, increasing the number of makers.
- âœ… **Sell before gather**: When gathering, if there are tokens left in the wallet, it sells the tokens first and gathers only SOL (the token account rent of 0.00203 SOL is reclaimed).
- âœ… **More buys than sells**: It randomly buys twice with SOL in the wallet and sells all tokens after some time, making the number of buys twice as many as sells, thus creating more buy pressure.

# Version 2 is developed and it is private repository.
